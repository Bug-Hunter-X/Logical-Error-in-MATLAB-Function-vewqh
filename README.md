# MATLAB Function with Logical Error

This repository contains a MATLAB function (`myFunction.m`) that exhibits a logical error.  The function is intended to perform specific calculations based on input values, but it produces incorrect results for certain inputs due to an error in the conditional statements. The solution (`myFunctionSolution.m`) demonstrates how the function can be corrected to produce the intended results.

## Bug Description

The `myFunction.m` function contains a flaw in its conditional logic. For specific ranges of input values, the calculations are not performed as intended leading to erroneous output.  The incorrect logic results in unexpected behavior and inaccurate results. The solution addresses the logical error to ensure accurate calculation for all possible input values.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `myFunction.m` with various input values, particularly testing boundary conditions and edge cases.
3. Observe the incorrect output for certain inputs.
4. Examine `myFunctionSolution.m` for the corrected implementation.
